Dear Tax Receipts User,

There have been a few new features added I wanted to let everyone know about.

1. We now support HTML in email templates. If you add HTML please be sure to test your emails in a real email client to make sure they display how you want.

2. The products table now has a button for configuring a custom email template per product. This allows you to run more customized donation campaigns!

As always I am here if you need anything.
